2. Map Objectives and Map Objects

To set a kill boss objective, set it as follows under your MiscBasedEvents.

	DefeatBoss(EndingScene)

A rout objective also goes under MiscBasedEvents.

	DefeatAll(EndingScene)

Seize is listed under LocationBasedEvents, and is set like so.

	Seize(x,y)

For a turn based objective, it is set under TurnBasedEvents as:

	TurnEventPlayer(0x3,EndingScene,Turn-1)



2.1 Simple Location Based Events

Chests can be set for either an item or a gold amount.

	Chest(Item,x,y)
	ChestMoney(Amount,x,y)

Doors can be set by location.

	Door(x,y)

Both go under LocationBasedEvents.



2.2 Shops

There are three types of shops, which are as follows:

	Armory(Items,x,y)
	Vendor(Items,x,y)
	SecretShop(Items,x,y)

You must define the items the shop sells in a list. You can do that by using SHLI followed by a list of your items, seperated by spaces.

	SampleItems: 
	SHLI IronSword IronLance IronAxe Fire
	ALIGN 4

And so the resulting command will look like this.

	Armory(SampleItems,x,y)

As per the others, this will go under LocationBasedEvents.



2.3 Houses and Villages

Houses and Villages are a little more complex since they call events once activated.
Under your LocationBasedEvents, you want to use

	House(event,x,y)
	Village(flag,event,x,y)

And then you want to set up the event for your village or house. While you can do whatever you like, there are macros for commonly used purposes, which are:

	VillageEventItem(Text,Background,Item)
	VillageEventMoney(Text,Background,Amount)
	HouseEvent(Text,Background)

I will provide a sample of a village event.

	LocationBasedEvents:
	Village(0x8,SampleVillageEvent,3,4)

	...

	SampleUnitGroup:
	UNIT Seth Paladin 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [1,2] 0 0 0 0 [SilverLance, SteelSword] NoAI
	UNIT

	...

	SampleVillageEvent:
	VillageEventItem(MyText,Village,Vulnerary)
	LoadReinforcements(SampleUnitGroup)
	ENDA

As you can see in SampleVillageEvent, it will have a normal village event with a conversation, give the visitor a vulnerary, and then spawn the specified unit group - in this case, Seth.
