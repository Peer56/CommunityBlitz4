You fool! You absolute buffoon![A][N]
You think you can challenge me[N]
in my own realm!?[A][N]
You think you can just rebel[N]
against my authority!?[A][N]
You dare come into my house[N]
and upturn my dining chairs,[A][N]
and spill coffee grounds in my Keurig!?[A][N]
You thought you were safe in your[N]
chainmail armor behind that screen of yours.[A][N]
[ToggleRed]I will take these laminate wood[N]
floor boards and destroy you![ToggleRed][A][N]
I didn't want war, but I didn't start it![A]

I am so tired of peeing.[A][N]
I drink the water,[N]
which I apparently need to live or something,[A][N]
then I have to go put the water[N]
somewhere else five minutes later.[A][N]
I drink the water,[N]
I go to a place to un-drink the water,[A][N]
I wash my hands,[N]
I leave,[A][N]
then I have to drink MORE water.[A][N]
Guess where that water ends up? Not in me![A][N]
I give the water to my body and like a[N]
child it tosses it out and demands more.[A][N]
All hours of the day,[N]
all hours of the night,[A][N]
no matter what I am doing my life is[N]
interrupted by PISS and this is BULLSHIT![A]

He ought soon be dead, making me[NL]
A whole lot less dead.[A][NL]
Compared to sticking here at least.[A][NL]
