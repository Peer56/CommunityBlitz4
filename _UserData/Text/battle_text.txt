You think you can defeat me?
I am the king of Wyrmland!
This means I am very strong!
Fighting strong enemies kills you!
You die when you are killed!
Thanks for attending my TED talk.[X]

Hehehe... I bet you envy how easy it is to be a bad guy...
No one asks for your character development...
No need to be a viable unit...
You can even have a terrible portrait, no one will care...
My life is so easy, I just sit here and pose no threat at all.
You player units must wish to be me, free from scrutiny... Hehe...[X]
