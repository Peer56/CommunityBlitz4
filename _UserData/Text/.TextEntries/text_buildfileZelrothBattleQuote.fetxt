Hehehe... I bet you envy how easy it is to be a bad guy...

No one asks for your character development...

No need to be a viable unit...

You can even have a terrible portrait, no one will care...

My life is so easy, I just sit here and pose no threat at all.

You player units must wish to be me, free from scrutiny... Hehe...[X]
